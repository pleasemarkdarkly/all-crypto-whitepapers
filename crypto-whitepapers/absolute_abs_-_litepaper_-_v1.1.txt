Litepaper
V1.1
10-June-18
This Litepaper is a cut down version of the whitepaper which is still in development.
This paper assumes that you already have a basic understanding of the cryptocurrency
environment.

The Coins Vision:
Our vision is to provide an advertising, promotions and event platform with smart contracts
that will have a global reach of network enablers. Our network will allow agents, organisers
and promoters the ability to reach a global audience and utilise their participation to achieve
their desired media goals.
The network is driven by ultra-low transaction fees, reliable and fast transactions (10x faster
than Bitcoin) which are supported by a large core network of Masternodes.

Mainnet Development
A newly developed Mainnet (specifications of which will be announced shortly) will be
attached to the current blockchain. De-synchronous sidechain implementation for smart
contracts will be initiated via collateral agent inputs and managed under escrow from upper
tier nodes.

Reward Structure
Proof of Stake (POS), Proof of View (POV), Proof of Work (POW), Masternodes (MN)

The ABS Cycle
Absolute aims to incentivise a healthy balance of holding and liquidity. To do this we will split
the reward structure as follows:

Holding Incentives
•

Masternodes
Masternodes are a way of earning rewards for holding coins: collateral is locked into
the network allowing stability. In return, Masternodes take it in turn to process the
network, receiving a reward for doing so.

•

POS
If an individual cannot hold enough coins to activate a Masternode, they can earn
rewards by holding over a specified amount until the coin matures. When this happens
they will start to receive rewards in the form of ABS.

Liquidity Incentives
•

POW
Hashing power from mining will supply security and stability to the network. In return
the network will offer 10% of the block chain reward structure to incentivise liquidity.

•

POV
The Proof of View network is funded via smart contracts. Agents set contracts which
are paid per interaction with the network. The interaction rewards are set by the agent.
A reward is issued per successful interaction between certain ‘actors’. The reward
distribution is set based upon the type of contract that is issued. These transactions
allow ABS to be distributed to multiple individuals and can in turn be sold. This
generates volume, formulating a new cycle.

*The current version V12.2.2a is using a Masternode collateral of 1000 ABS. This will
be replaced by a 2500 ABS minimum requirement in the next version (V12.2.3a) which
will then become the new base tier.

Network Interaction
Although the POV network is totally transparent, there is a collateral requirement that must
be met to allow access to the POV Masternode network. These nodes process the POV
transactions and administer contract escrow. They also provide agents, enablers, users and the
network with rewards based on the interactions.
In return for processing a POV interaction, the network will receive an additional reward on
top of the block reward. In times of high network transactions, this will mean an increased ROI
for POV Masternodes.
The POV network controls the escrow funds held for each contract. When a contract
interaction occurs, the POV network commands the POV nodes to release escrow funds to the
required interactors at specific periods during the day.
All transactions on the POV network are used to process ABS in an efficient way. This means
that when there is high activity on the POV network it will have minimum effect on standard
transactions on the ABS Mainnet.
The POV network is controlled and maintained directly by the POV Masternodes including
block sealing. There is no reward structure on this network, its primary use is to facilitate
payment on the Mainnet and reward ‘actors’.

3

Network Terminology
The POV network is made up of a number of ‘actors’. These are people that interact with the
network to successfully process a transaction.

•

Agent
Agents are the contract initiators. They purchase ABS from an exchange and then issue
contracts based on their needs.

•

Enablers
Certain contracts require ‘enablers’ to create adverts and distribute media, either in a
physical form or online. If they have met the requirements of the contract and a lead is
generated, they will receive a reward for their interactions. These rewards depend on
the type of contract they are fulfilling.

•

Users
These are end users who communicate with the enablers or agent via the network to
produce an interaction. It is possible for users to be rewarded based on their
interaction with certain contracts.

•

POV Nodes
A POV node is the core network processor. Masternodes receive rewards for
processing interaction information on the network.

Tier network reward structure
To keep the network fair for all users, there will be equal share of the block reward based on a
1:1 ABS distribution offset against collateral. The upper tier nodes will receive rewards from
the POV network as well, which will increase the ROI over the base tier.

Proof of View (POV)
Proof of View allows network agents to form advertising, promotion or event based contracts.
Agents must have an active connection to the network either via the wallet or via a website
that is connected to a POV node. This website can be set up by Masternode holders that have
the highest tier nodes. Contracts can be formed based on the following areas:
•

(LOC) Location based contracts qualified via an Apple or Android wallet
o

•

•

These rewards are based on an agent trying to attract people to a location for a
specific reason such as, but not limited to, an event, conference, party or
festival.

(PHY/ PHY-LOC) Physical based capture contracts qualified via an Apple or Android
wallet. These are split into two areas based on pre-defined interactions:
o

(PHY) Media capture via a smart phone with the wallet installed.
Before the campaign starts, adverts are catalogued and imported into the POV
system, receiving an individual ID. The wallet will then match to this ID and will
supply links to the advert which will generate a lead for the agent.

o

(PHY-LOC) Location media capture via a smart phone with the wallet installed.
These must be in a certain location to receive rewards. This is a double
verification process which combines standard physical based capture (PHY)
and location.

(SAW) Social media and website based lead generation contracts. These come under
two different criteria:
o

o

(SAW-U) Unqualified Leads – these interactions are not subsidised via the
collateral buffer and can only be funded via the agent’s collateral alone:


Website adverts and banners processed via the network when an
interaction occurs.



Outbound media, based on click per view.

(SAW-Q) Qualified Leads - these interactions are subsidised via the collateral
buffer and can only be funded via the agent’s collateral:


•

Lead Generation which results in a detailed form submission or website
order attached to the contract ID.

(UES) Users can become enablers by republishing media if the contract allows it.

Most contracts are subsidised by the block reward structure via the collateral buffer.

5

Collateral Buffer
The Collateral buffer is a stabilisation fund that bridges between the block reward and
the POV network. It provides two outputs:
•

A Proof of View contracts subsidy. This allows a subsidy percentage based on the level
of engagement in the POV system. High demand will reduce the subsidy to a lower
percentage. Lower demand will increase the percentage until 20% of the contract value
is met.

•

The second is an average output to counteract the dynamic adjustment algorithm that
keeps the buffer full. This makes it fairer for Masternodes that received funds from the
buffer overflow to receive a stable reward figure daily. This amount is split between the
total number of nodes that have been active for more than one day and is transferred
to all nodes on a daily basis.

Loading conditions
The reward structure is dynamically adjusted to allow the Collateral buffer to stay full based
on demand. Here are a few loading condition examples:

POV Loading Conditions explanation
•

None – The buffer is full and awaiting a smart contract to be initiated. All additional
supply from the 28% allocation is diverted to the Masternodes and paid daily to all
qualifying nodes.

•

Medium – The buffer is in use but requires funding from the reward structure to stay at
the algorithm’s specific target. As only 50% of the block funding is required, the other
50% is dispensed to the Masternodes and paid once a day to all qualifying nodes.

•

High – The buffer is being depleted rapidly and all available funding is initialised to
restore collateral within the buffer.

The buffer will always pull a minimum of 2% from the block reward. This allows growth of the
fund over time in a sustainable way. The base size of the fund is allocated via Governance. The
subsidy algorithm tracks demand for the fund and in turn increases or decreases the size of the
fund and subsidy percentage accordingly.

POV Reward
The POV reward system is funded by agents that wish to create smart contracts. Enablers,
POV Nodes and users then receive percentages of the POV reward structure based on the
type of interaction that is occurring in the contract.
Subsidy amounts are adjusted based on loading conditions; the POV network will always
receive a base percentage per contract.
Below is a standard overview of the reward structure for different contract areas based on full
load.

Reward scenario for POV
The table below is an average reward based on 10,000 ABS being spent in one day on the POV
network. This is assuming that all contracts are equal in volume (5.8% POV Fee). This reward
can be added to the standard block reward. These are extreme conditions based on each end of
the loadings range.

This is the total reward, which would need to be distributed equally across the tier level.
