Introduction:
Alpha Coin It has many applications in the
financial services industry. Almost every
bank
SWIFT
messages
are
currently
used to
securely
conduct transactions, but Smart Ethereum
contracts This can cause the network to
become obsolete. Distributed notebooks can
be stabilized Calculate faster and save
banks, and consumers, up to $ 20 billion a

Year (a large number of secure items),
which would also help protect banks from
unethical employee behavior and subsequent
pressure.
One of the company's goals is to remove a
major obstacle to the mining, which is the
first company to mining tokens, "APC"
technology is the It is the right solution for
many minerals, and resolve the problems
that the two minerals complain about is the
consumption of energy and the longer time
to get the value few for offer effort.

What is APC?
Alpha Coin (APC) is an open source,
Based on ethereum, Smart Contract ERC
20 of with special script algorithm.
Alpha coin is based for the basis of firstclass mining, experts were appointed to
develop the mining farm.

What are our goals?
The first goal is mining APC by less
electrical energy and less time. At the same
time as the interest in the digital process is
diminishing, the electricity consumption bill
is increasing as a result of its mining. More
electricity is consumed in mining operations
than in other countries, such as Ireland,
Electricity consumption from "mining"
by composition does not appear to be
slowing, and consumption is increasing as
computers and large servers require 24-hour
mining.

Mining is a process of searching for
currency in a large number of connected
devices around the world, by decoding a set
of codes according to specific algorithms.
"Mining" is based on the use of a large
number of computers to process requests
and decode their packages, which can be
implemented individually or collectively,
requiring devices that consume electricity
around the clock.
Some have viewed Petequin's "mining"
as a cause of global warming, with
increasing reports indicating that it
consumes more electricity than the
consumption of entire nations.

According to a new report, the
accelerated increase in electricity
consumption due to mining will consume
about 7.7 gigawatts, which is consumed by a
country such as Austria, making "mining" a
41% source of electricity demand.
Mining is expected to consume 2.5
gigawatts of electricity, compared with 3.1
gigawatts currently consumed by Ireland.
Demand for electricity due to mining
continues to increase worldwide. In Iceland,
more energy is being planned for "mining"
in composition, at a time when the Chinese
government plans to suppress mining
because of its excessive consumption of
electricity.

The greater the number of processors
used to search for configuration, the greater
the consumption of electricity, especially as
the decryption of virtual currency strings
becomes more difficult over time.
In May last year, average electricity
consumption from "mining" averaged
around 14 TWh per year, and consumption
is likely to rise to more than 67 TWh per
year.
APC works to solve all these problems.

NOTE: This is just an idea and to
apply it must work on it and our experts will
start with the beginning of 2020.

Risks
1. Risks associated with taxation: The
tax treatment and accounting of the
Coins is uncertain and may vary
amongst jurisdictions. You must seek
independent tax advice in connection
with purchasing the Coins, which
may result in adverse tax
consequences to you.
2. Risks associated with volatility of
ETH: The value of ETH may
fluctuate significantly over a short
period of time as a result of various
factors including market dynamics,
regulatory changes, technical

Advancements, and economic and
political factors.
3. Risk of Loss of private key: The
Coins may only be accessed with a
combination of authenticator and
password. Loss of authenticator(s)
associated with your digital wallet or
vault storing the Coins will result in
loss of such Coins which will be
unrecoverable and permanently lost.
4. Risk associated with the
development, operation and
maintenance of the APC project.
